### Project

## Infrastructure.py
For the infrastructures, the system will be American. There will be two different available forms of infrastructure based off the most prevalent forms found in the US.

# Grid
The grid infrastructure will represent cities like New York or Chicago where the roads and avenues are lined up perpendicular.

# Highway
The highway infrastructure will represent cities like Tucson where there will be highways that each have an amount of smaller roads connected to them as well as freeways that each have an amount of highways connected to them.

## Transportation.py
For the transportation, there will be multiple different available forms of transportation such as trains, cars, buses, bikes, and walking.

# Variables
The different factors that will affect the viability for a mode of transportation will include: cost, size of vehicle, time required to start moving, parking, transport time, environmental impact, traffic, safety, maintainability, and how well it works with the infrastructure.

## Aditional System Constraints
Some other potential constraints to consider are: population, crime statistics, the size of the infrastructure, comfortability(ex: screaming child), and the culture of the area (for example, some places are more culturally prone to walking)

## Use Cases for the System
This system will be able to calculate the recommended form of transportation based on user-inputted system constraints. The system will also have the capabilities of assessing a range of different possible combinations of constraints to find potential solutions to better optimize what is currently being used.
Output different potential options with different stats

the breakdown may look like:
Car(potentially different models of car): 
price: #######         
speed: ##########

Try to find a niche that is not filled

# Meeting
have an option for different disabilities
